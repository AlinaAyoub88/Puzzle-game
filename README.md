# Puzzle-game
This is my first git respository.
 simple 4x4 sliding puzzle game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Move the tiles by clicking to arrange numbers in order. Tracks your moves and gives a win message when completed. Clean design, responsive layout, and pure JavaScript logic â€” perfect for practice or fun!
